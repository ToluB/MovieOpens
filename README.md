Simple regression project to predict opening weekend movie grosses

My first project for Metis Data Science bootcamp.  
For this project I built a simple regression model to predict the opening weekend box office gross for major theatrical releases.
Data was gathered by scraping Box Office Mojo and IMDBPro using Beautiful Soup and Selenium, and with a little Google Search legwork (to fill in the data on prequels).
The model was fairly effective for such a rudimentary piece of work.  It could likely be dramatically improved by adding a few key features (e.g. total sequel gross, sequel ratings/reviews, and social media sentiment for upcoming movies).
