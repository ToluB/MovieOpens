My first project for Metis bootcamp: a simple regression model to predict opening weekend movie grosses for major theatrical releases

 Data was gathered by scraping Box Office Mojo and IMDBPro using Beautiful Soup and Selenium. Data on sequels had to be filled in manually (via Google Search).
The model was fairly effective, but could likely be dramatically improved by adding a few key features (e.g. total prequel gross, prequel ratings/reviews, and social media sentiment for upcoming movies).
